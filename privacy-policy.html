            <p>For the sake of completeness, we would like to inform users whose domicile or headquarters are <span>in Switzerland</span> that the United States is subject to surveillance measures by the US authorities. These measures generally allow the recording of all personal data of persons whose data has been transferred from Switzerland to the United States. This is done without any differentiation, limitation or exception based on purpose and without any objective criterion for limiting the access of the U.S. authorities to the data and their further use to very specific and strictly limited purposes that can justify the harm involved in accessing and using the data. Furthermore, we would like to inform you that in the United States, there is no means of redress for data subjects <span>from Switzerland</span> to gain access to your data and to have it corrected or deleted, nor do we have effective legal protection against general access rights of the US authorities. We explicitly draw the attention of the data subject to this legal and factual situation so that he or she can make an informed decision about consenting to the use of his or her data. </p>
            
            <p>We inform users domiciled in <span>an EU member</span> state that, according to the EU, the United States - in particular due to the issues discussed in this section - does not have an adequate level of data protection. Insofar as we have explained in this privacy policy that certain data recipients (e.g. Google) are based in the United States, we will ensure either through contractual arrangements with these companies or through their certification according to the EU-US or Swiss-US Data Protection Shield that your data is afforded a reasonable level of protection by our partners.</p>
